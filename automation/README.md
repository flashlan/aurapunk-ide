# Automated supervision: TUI + Telegram + PM agent

This directory ties together the automation layer built on top of the
vibe-kanban backend. The goal: a solo developer can run more, longer tasks
without babysitting — when a coding agent would otherwise **stop mid-loop**
waiting for attention (a tool-permission prompt or a clarifying question), it is
surfaced to Telegram and answered there, either by a human or by the PM agent,
unblocking the agent automatically.

See the design plan: `~/.claude/plans/ethereal-crafting-lemon.md`.

## The pieces

| Component | What it is | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **TUI** (`aurapunk-tui`) | Terminal cockpit: list workspaces/sessions, watch live agent transcripts, and an **approvals inbox** to approve/deny/answer locally. Also the always-available manual override. | `crates/tui` |
| **Bridge** (`aurapunk-telegram-bridge`) | Send-only daemon: backend approvals stream → Telegram escalation messages (with a machine-readable footer). Optionally spawns a **per-worktree forum topic** for each Claude Code worktree and routes that worktree's escalations there. Never reads Telegram, never polls the bot token. | `crates/telegram-bridge` |
| **MCP approval tools** | `respond_to_approval` + `stop_execution` added to `aurapunk-mcp` (global mode) so the PM agent can unblock/stop agents. | `crates/mcp` |
| **PM agent** | A Claude Code session on the sombrax-telegram channel that reads escalations, decides within guardrails, and acts via the MCP tools. | `automation/pm-agent` |

### Flow

```

                                    Telegram channel
                                    ╱            ╲
                              human reply     PM agent (sombrax-telegram
                              (or TUI)         channel session)
                                                   │ respond_to_approval (MCP)
                                                   ▼
                                       backend unblocks the worker
```

The human can always override via the **TUI** (direct to the backend) or by
messaging in Telegram while the PM agent is up.

## Running it

1. **Backend** (the orchestration engine):
   ```bash
   BACKEND_PORT=8910 cargo run --bin server
   ```

2. **TUI** (local cockpit / manual override), in another terminal:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p tui            # discovers the backend via its port file
   ```
   Keys: `a` approvals inbox · `n` new task · `i` message an agent · `?` help.

3. **Telegram bridge** — configured by `~/.vibe-kanban/telegram.toml` (the bot
   token still falls back to `$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or
   `~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env`, the same file the sombrax-telegram
   listener uses):
   ```toml
   # ~/.vibe-kanban/telegram.toml
   enabled = true
   bot_token = "123456:ABC..."        # optional; falls back to env / .env file
   chat_id = "-1001234567890"         # your supergroup (must have Topics enabled)
   general_thread_id = "1"            # optional General topic
   per_worktree_topics = true         # spawn a forum topic per Claude Code worktree
   # topic_executors = ["CLAUDE_CODE"]  # optional; which executors get a topic
   # topic_name_template = "vk: {name}" # optional; {name}/{branch} substituted
   ```
   ```bash
   cargo run -p telegram-bridge
   ```
   When `enabled = false` (or no config and no `VK_TG_CHAT_ID`) the daemon exits
   cleanly. Legacy env vars (`VK_TG_CHAT_ID`, `VK_TG_GENERAL_THREAD_ID`) still
   work as a fallback when the TOML is absent.

   With `per_worktree_topics = true`, the bridge watches the backend's
   `/api/events` stream and, when a Claude Code worktree starts, creates a forum
   topic named from `topic_name_template` and routes that worktree's escalations
   into it (everything else goes to the General area). The
   `workspace_id → message_thread_id` map is persisted in
   `~/.vibe-kanban/telegram-topics.json` so restarts reuse existing topics.

   The app surfaces a **Settings → Telegram** panel (status + a "Send test
   message" button); it reads `telegram.toml` and the bridge's heartbeat file
   but does not edit the config — the TOML is hand-edited.

4. **PM agent** — a long-lived Claude Code session on the sombrax-telegram
   channel, with the vibe-kanban MCP in **global** mode and the PM prompt/policy:
   - Configure `aurapunk-mcp --mode global` as an MCP server, with
     `VIBE_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8910` so it targets the same backend.
   - Launch a Claude Code session on the sombrax-telegram channel for the
     supergroup, appending `pm-agent/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` and keeping
     `pm-agent/PM_POLICY.md` in its working directory.
   - The sombrax-telegram listener must be running (it owns the single bot
     poller); the PM agent is its listener client. The bridge is **send-only**,
     so it coexists without a 409 conflict.

## Orchestrator context watchdog

The backend hosts an `OrchestratorCompactor` background task (60s tick,
`crates/services/src/services/orchestrator_compactor.rs`, spawned next to the
recurrent scheduler in `crates/local-deployment/src/lib.rs`) that keeps the
singleton Orchestrator session's Claude context from silently growing
unbounded across a days-long run. Every tick, if the Orchestrator's session is
live, it measures the summed `input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens +
cache_read_input_tokens` from the last assistant record in its transcript
JSONL and, when a trigger fires, types `/compact` into its tmux session (the
typed-keys path — `send_interactive_input`, which executes slash commands;
never the bracketed-paste `send_interactive_message`, which would land
`/compact` as literal text).

Two triggers, either of which sends a compaction:
- **Size:** measured context exceeds **400,000 tokens** (`token_threshold`).
- **Age:** the session hasn't been compacted for **1 hour** (`max_age`) *and*
  its context is at least **50,000 tokens** (`age_floor_tokens` — compacting a
  near-empty context is pure information loss).

A **10-minute cooldown** (`cooldown`) since the last send gates both triggers
(widened to `max(cooldown, max_age)` once escalated, as a backoff). Every
`/compact` actually sent logs one `tracing::info!` line. If a resend doesn't
bring usage back under the threshold for **3 consecutive attempts**, the
watchdog logs at error level and fires one best-effort Telegram escalation
(reusing `telegram.toml` above — no separate config). When there's no live
Orchestrator, its tmux session is dead, or its transcript is unreadable, the
watchdog no-ops silently (debug-level log at most) — it never crashes the
server or acts on a dead session.

Configured via a hand-edited `~/.vibe-kanban/orchestrator.toml`
(`~/.vibe-kanban-dev` in debug builds), matching the `telegram.toml` /
recurrent-routine precedent — an absent file uses the defaults below with the
feature **on**; an invalid or unreadable file warns once and falls back to
defaults (never disabled silently, never a crash):

```toml
# ~/.vibe-kanban/orchestrator.toml
[compact]
enabled = true            # default true — file absent ⇒ feature on with defaults
max_age = "1h"            # time-based trigger period
token_threshold = 400000  # size-based trigger
age_floor_tokens = 50000  # min context for the age trigger to bother
cooldown = "10m"          # min gap between sends
```

Set `enabled = false` to disable the watchdog entirely. Durations use the same
`30m` / `1h` format as the recurrent routine TOMLs (integer + one of
`s`/`m`/`h`/`d`).

## Verification

- TUI: `cargo test -p tui` (unit + render) and, against a running backend,
  `VIBE_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8910 cargo test -p tui -- --ignored`.
- Bridge: `cargo test -p telegram-bridge` (patch parsing + message formatting).
- MCP: `cargo test -p mcp` (the global-mode tool set includes the approval tools).
- Orchestrator compactor: `cargo test -p services orchestrator_compactor`
  (config parsing, transcript usage parser, trigger-decision table tests).
- End-to-end: trigger a real approval (e.g. an agent task that runs a
  permission-gated command), confirm the escalation appears in Telegram and that
  approving it (via the PM agent, the TUI, or a human) unblocks the worker.
